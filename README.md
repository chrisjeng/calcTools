CalcTools
===
Compilation of small calculation files.
## FindMod
Made for CS 70, Spring 2015. Can experimentally try values for mod-type questions.

## Cesar
Made to encode and decode Caesar shifts. Run `java Cesar --help` for assistance. Toggle verbose-mode or file-mode with `-v` and `-f` flags respectively. By default, file-mode will read from `in.txt` and write output to `out.txt` unless otherwise specified in arguments.

## Par
Can calculate parallel resistor values.

#### TODO:
* Suggest resistor combinations to reach a target resistance value based on what's available in your lab.
